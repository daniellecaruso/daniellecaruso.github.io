		<h1 class="daniellemcaruso">Danielle M Caruso</h1> 
		<p class="aboutme-paragraph"> I attend the University Of Connecticut at the Stamford campus. 

I’m from Norwalk, CT & I love my city. So much that I’ve got my area code tattooed. 

I have two dogs, Simba & Leo. Simba is a Black Lab/Pitbull mix and Leo is a Corgi mix.

I love to travel – I’ve been to: China, Morocco, Jamaica, Cayman Islands, Mexico, Belize & Honduras.

I’m a certified phlebotomist. Before UCONN, I was pursuing a nursing degree and took up phlebotomy on the side. I worked at Quest Diagnostics for 6 months in Naples, FL until moving back to my beloved hometown. </p>
