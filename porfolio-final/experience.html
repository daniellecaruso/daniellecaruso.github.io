<section class="section-resume">

I am a junior at the University of Connecticut at Stamford. I am studying digital media strategies for business and would love to work with digital marketing or advertising. I graduated from the Center for Global Studies at Brien McMahon H.S. in 2012, where I studied Chinese (Mandarin) and Arabic. While there, I received two scholarships to travel with my Arabic class on a study tour of Morocco. I recently left my job at the Nine West Outlet in Norwalk, CT to focus on my studies. I was hired as a sales associate in April 2015 and was hired to an assistant manager within two months. Here, I delegated tasks amongst associates, met sales goals, and ensured attentive customer service at all times. I am currently a member of SPECTRUM, UCONN Stamford’s LGBTQ and ally group. I have a lot of experience of being a part of a team, as well as leading a team.
